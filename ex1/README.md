# Example 1

The bare minimum code to import the OctoKit module from GitHub. We will actually call the module later, but this is just a starting form. Note the extension is `.mjs` instead of `.js` which will also be fixed later.

## Samples provided

- **hello.mjs** - Stub file simply to show basic import syntax

## Walkthrough

To run through these examples, after reviewing the source, perform the following:

    node hello.mjs
